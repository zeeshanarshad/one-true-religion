# About RightfulReligion.com By the Mercy of ALLAH (اللہ)

Rightful Religion was established online in 2009 based on research work of Moulana Abrar Alam the Spiritual Doctor of Incurable Diseases and Neutral Muslim Scholar of Islam.

The purpose of this website is to help truth seekers find one true religion in the light of behaviors of nature with true Muslims by the Permission & Command of Allah the Greatest.

All miracles on this website are properly researched, well tested and proven on the basis of medical doctors, lawyers, journalists, media channel reports, newspapers, etc and the rest relies on the general public with their real video footage.

No AI-work has been done for demonstrating or showing off miracles of Allah as long as it doesn't come under the business of Hajira Spiritual Treatment Center or Spiritual Shop where marketing material is used with graphics and animations where needed.

Know that what you see is real on this website in the sections of Fresh Dead Bodies, Spiritual Surgeon Soul and Natural Creatures.

Welcome to the World of Spiritual Technologies & Advanced Spiritual Science of Islam by the Mercy of Allah.

Feel free to modify or change or distribute all of our work anywhere on the internet since you have no objection from us and can freely work for Allah to prevail Islam over all false religions of this world.
