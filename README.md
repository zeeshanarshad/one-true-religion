# RightfulReligion.com

Rightful Religion was established online in 2009 based on research work of Moulana Abrar Alam the Spiritual Doctor of Incurable Diseases and Neutral Muslim Scholar of Islam. He has proved through irrefutable miracles that there is no God except Allahﷻ, Prophet Muhammadﷺ is the last and final messenger of Allahﷻ, Quran is the true Holy Book and Islam is the only true religion of God (Allah). Time to time, this website has been upgraded and now it is a well-organized platform with only core sections and the rest into downloadable stuff to make it easier for people of the world to study the material and research from the comfort of their homes without internet, once downloaded the resources. 

# Core Sections:

1) ALLAHﷻ in Nature
2) Born Muslim
3) Alive Dead Bodies
4) Surgeon Soul

Study the research, understand it and then spread it to the Non-Muslims, Ex-Muslims, Atheists and Doubtful Muslims of the world.
